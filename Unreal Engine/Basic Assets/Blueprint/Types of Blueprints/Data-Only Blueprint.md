A **Data-Only** Blueprint is Blueprint Class that contains only the code (in the form of node graphs), variablesm and components inherited from its parent. These allow inhereted properties to be tweaked and modefied, but no new elments can be added. These are essentially a replacement for archetypes and can be used to allow designers to tweak properties or set items with variations.

Data-Only Blueprint are edited in a compact property editor, but can also be "converted" to full Blueprints by simply adding code, variables, or componentsusing the full **Blueprint Editor**.
