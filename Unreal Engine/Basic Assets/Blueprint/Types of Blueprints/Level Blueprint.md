A **Level Blueprint** is a specialized type of Blueprint that acts as a level-wide global event graph. Each level in your project has its own Level Blueprint created by default that can be edited within the Unreal Editor, however new Level Blueprint cannot be created throgh the editor interface.

Events pertaining to the level as a whole, or specific instances of [Actors](Actor.md) within the level, are used to fire off sequences of actions in the form of [[Function Calls]] or [[Flow Control]] operations.

Level Blueprints also provide a controle mechanism for level streaming and [Sequencer](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/real-time-compositing-with-sequencer-in-unreal-engine) as well as for binding events to [Actors](Actor.md) placed within the level.
