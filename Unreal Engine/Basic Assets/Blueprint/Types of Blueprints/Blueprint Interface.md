A **Blueprint Interface** is a collection of one or more functions - name only, no implementation - that can be added to other Blueprints. Any Blueprint that has Interface added is guaranted to have those functions. The functions of the Interface can be given functionality in each of the Blueprints that added it. This is essentially like concept of [interface](Interface.md) in general programming, which allows multiple different types of [Objects](Object.md) to all share and be accessed through comon interface.

Blueprint Interfaces can be made by content creators through the editor in a similar fashion to other Bluprints, but they come with certain limitations in that they cannot:
- Add new variables
- Edit graphs
- Add Components
