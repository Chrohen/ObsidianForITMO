A **Level** is a gameplay area that you define. Levels contain everything a player can see and interact with, such as geometry, [Pawns](Pawn.md), and [Actors](Actor.md).

Unreal Engine saves each level as a aseparate **`.umap`** file, which is why you will sometimes see them referred to as **Maps**.

A Level is a collection of Actors (lights, volumes, mesh instances etc.).
Multiple Levels can be loaded and unloaded into the World to creat streaming expirience.
