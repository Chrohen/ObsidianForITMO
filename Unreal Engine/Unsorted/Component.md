A Component is a piece of functionality that can be added to an Actor.

When you add a Component to an Actor, the Actor can use the functionality that the Component provides. For example:
- A [[Spot Light Component]] will make your Actor emit light like a spot light.
- A [[Rotating Movement Component]] will make your Actor spin around.
- An [[Audio Component]] will give ypur Actor the ability to play sounds.

Components must be attached to an Actor and can't exist by themselves.
