**Volumes** are bounded 3D spaces that have different uses based on the effects attached to them. For example:
- **Blocking Volumes** are invisible and used to prevent [Actors](Actor.md) from passing throug them
- **Pain Causing Volumes** cause damage over time to any [[Actor]] that overlaps them
- **Trigger Volumes** are programmed to cause events when an [[Actor]] enters ir exits them
