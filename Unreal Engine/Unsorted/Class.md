A Class defines the behaviors and properties of a particular Actor or Object in Unreal Engine. Classes are hierarchical, meaning a Class inherits information from its parent Class (that is, the Class it was derived or "sub-classed" from) and passes that information to its children. Classes can be created in C++ or in Blueprints.
