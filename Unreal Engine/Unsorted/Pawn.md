**Pawns** are a subclass of [[Actor]] and serve as an in-game avatar or persona (for example, the characters in game). Pawns can be controlled by a player or by the game's AI, as non-player characters (NPCs).

When a pawn is controlled by a human or AI player, it is considered to be *Possessed*. Conversely, when a Pawn is not controlled by a human or AI player, it is cosidered to be *Unpossessed*.
