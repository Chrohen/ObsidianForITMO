Just as the [[Player Controller]] posseses a [[Pawn]] as a representation of the player in a game, an **AIController** possesses a [[Pawn]] to represent a non-player character (NPC) in a game. By default, [Pawns](Pawn.md) and [Characters](Character.md) will end up with a base AI Controller unless they are specifically possessed by a [[Player Controller]] or told not to ctreate an AI Controller for themselves.

The assosiated C++ class is **`AIController`**.
