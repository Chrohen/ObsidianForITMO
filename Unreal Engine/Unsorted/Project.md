An Unreal Engine 5 Project holds all the contents of your game. Int contains a number of folders on your disk, such as **`Blueprints`**  and **`Materials`**. You can name and organize folders inside a Project however you wish. The **Content Browser** panel inside the **Unreal Editor** shows the same directory structure found inside th **`Project`** folder on your disk.

Every project has a **`.uproject`** file assosiated with it. The **`.uproject`** file is how you create, open, or save a project. You can create any number of different projects and wor on them in parallel.
