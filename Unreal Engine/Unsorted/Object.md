Objects are the most basic class in Unreal Engine - in other words, they act like building blocks and contain a lot of the essential functionality for Assets. Almost everything in Unreal Engine inherits (or gets some functionality) from Object.

In C++, UObject is the base class of all objects; it implements features such as garbage collections, metadata (**`UProperty`**) support for exposing variables to the Unreal Editor, and serialization for loading and saving.
